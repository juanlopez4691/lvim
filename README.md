# lvim

## Description 
This is my own custom configuration settings for LunarVim.

LunarVim is a brilliant, `less is more` oriented configuration framework for neovim
created by [Christian Chiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli) and supported
by a growing community.

To get an idea of what LunarVim is about, have a look at the original
[LunarVim repo](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim) and the
[project website lunarvim.org](https://www.lunarvim.org/).

## Caveats
This configuration is based on branch `rolling` in the project, which is frequently
updated with code changes. This means things may get broken at any time.
